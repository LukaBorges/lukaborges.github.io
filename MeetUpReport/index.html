    <h1> Software Engineering Daily Podcast: Engineering & AI Talks </h1>
    
    <p> Hi, my name is Luana and I am here to talk about the meeting that I participated.
  The meeting that I attended was about softwares that we use in our daily life and how we can work better using them.

     <p> J Levi talked about <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and the improvements that they've achieved so far.
     Also Amir Shevat one of the developers of <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> talked about the system and how the software helps them in collaborative work.
     Slack is a cloud-based team collaboration tool and began as an internal tool used by their company. Slack teams allow communities, groups, or teams to join through a specific URL or invitation sent by a team admin or owner. Although Slack was meant for organizational communication, it has been slowly turning into a community platform, a function for which users had previously used message boards or social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn groups. Many of these communities are categorized by topics which a group of people may be interested in discussing.

     <p> The last topic they talked about was AI. Presenting bot examples and how it can be useful in our life.
     Honestly I was little bit scared about this part just to imagine how far we can go with technology.
     I really liked to attend this meeting and I learned a lot in few hours. People are nice and friendly and definitely I want to go again to another meetings.
